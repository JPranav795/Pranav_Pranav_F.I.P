# Pranav_Pranav_F.I.P

__This is the repo for the F.I.P of the Interactive Media Design Course Semester 1__

## About:

In this project we were given a task to showcase our ability of making a functional website based on _'The Couples Resort Website'_.

In this specific subject, we have to create 3 mobile for the _Couples Resort_ and 1 desktop page of our own choice. So I made the desktop page on the topic- '

## Functionality:

__There are 3 mobile pages-__

   - About
   - Packages
   - Spa 

   These all pages are interlinked to each other, that means that by clicking on the burger menu of any of the page, we can choose which page to navigate to.

## Specific Functions:

I have used the __keyframe animations__ for the ___'Book Now'___ button on every page, for that you just have to hover over the button to make the button bounce nad shine. :D

There is also a __checkbox__ for the _"Accept Cookies"_ line. Where I have put the ::after psuedo function for adding emoji.

## !!! Disclaimer !!!

I have made a __About page out of the context__, but I contacted _'Jarrod'_ and he told me that we can make an about page as an extended version.

## The Picture Of CR:
